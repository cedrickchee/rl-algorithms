# Introduction

This repository contains my notebook and code for practices and implementations for common Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. These are meant to serve as an educational materials.

Each directory is corresponds to one or more RL algorithms.

All code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Advanced techniques use TensorFlow for neural network implementations.
